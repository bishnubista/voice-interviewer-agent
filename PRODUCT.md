Detailed Implementation Plan
Extension 1: Clerk Authentication (Dev 1)
Setup Phase (9:00-10:00 AM)

Create a new Next.js application

bash npx create-next-app clerk-auth-extension
cd clerk-auth-extension

Install Clerk SDK and dependencies

bash npm install @clerk/nextjs

Set up environment variables for Clerk API keys

Development Phase 1 (10:00 AM-12:00 PM)

Configure Clerk provider in the application
Implement sign-up and sign-in pages
Create middleware for protected routes
Implement user profile management
Set up role-based access control (if needed for market research scenarios)

Development Phase 2 (12:30-2:30 PM)

Create an API endpoint for authentication status
Implement session management
Add OAuth providers if beneficial (Google, GitHub, etc.)
Style the authentication components to match main app aesthetics
Add documentation for integration with the main app
Prepare containerization for easy integration later

Extension 2: Voice AI Interviewer (Dev 2)
Setup Phase (9:00-10:00 AM)

Create a new Next.js application

bash npx create-next-app voice-interviewer-extension
cd voice-interviewer-extension

Install necessary dependencies

bash npm install react-speech-recognition web-speech-api openai axios tone-analyzer

```
3. Set up environment for voice recording and processing

#### Development Phase 1 (10:00 AM-12:00 PM)
1. Implement voice recording functionality
2. Create UI for interviewer and interviewee interaction
3. Implement real-time transcription of spoken responses
4. Set up basic conversation flow for market research interviews
5. Create initial prompt templates for different interview scenarios

#### Development Phase 2 (12:30-2:30 PM)
1. Implement AI response generation for dynamic follow-up questions
2. Add sentiment analysis to gauge respondent reactions
3. Implement key insights extraction from responses
4. Create visualization for interview data
5. Add export functionality for collected research data
6. Prepare API endpoints for future integration with main app

### Integration Planning (Your Role)

#### Setup Phase (9:00-10:00 AM)
1. Create a basic diagram showing how both extensions will integrate with the main app
2. Establish communication protocols between the extensions
3. Define API contract for both extensions to ensure seamless integration later
4. Set up a shared GitHub repository with branch structure

#### Development Support (10:00 AM-2:30 PM)
1. Coordinate between both developers to ensure compatibility
2. Document integration points for future implementation
3. Create a minimal integration example to demonstrate concept
4. Prepare presentation materials for the demo

#### Demo Preparation (2:00-2:30 PM)
1. Consolidate key features from both extensions
2. Create a compelling narrative for judges focusing on:
   - How these extensions enhance market research capabilities
   - The technical innovation in both components
   - Potential business impact of improved authentication and voice interviewing
3. Practice the 5-minute pitch with clear role distribution

Integration Strategy

Create a shared API interface between components
Use authentication tokens from Clerk to secure voice interview sessions
Design both extensions with containerization in mind (Docker)
Document clear integration points for the main application

Demo Script (2:30-4:00 PM)

Introduction (30 seconds)

Explain the market research app concept
Highlight the need for secure authentication and more natural data collection

Clerk Authentication Demo (2 minutes)

Show sign-up/sign-in flow
Demonstrate role-based access
Showcase security features and user management

Voice AI Interviewer Demo (2 minutes)

Show a live voice interview session
Demonstrate the AI's ability to ask follow-up questions
Display insights and data visualization from the interview

Integration Vision (30 seconds)

Explain how these components enhance the existing app
Highlight the business value and competitive advantage

Post-Hackathon Integration Plan

Create a unified API layer
Implement Clerk authentication in the main app
Integrate the voice interviewer component
Conduct end-to-end testing
Deploy the enhanced application
